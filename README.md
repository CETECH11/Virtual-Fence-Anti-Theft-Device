In 2022, over 1 million theft cases, which is a 7% rise compared to 2021, have become a great concern in India. With a population of more than 1.4 billion, you never know whom to trust apart from your own self.

Hence, we are left with only one solution - Track Your Belongings

With the increased availability of devices to access the internet, we all need an automated system, that keeps us updated on our physical product and informs us if it has been moved from its designated location.

But, how do we track them? And how should one get an alert of a theft? We shall see and build a project on that.

A Fence is a physical boundary, which is used to restrict kids and dogs from exiting the border Boundaries provide a layer of security, which also restricts entry from outside. But these boundaries need to be maintained heavily. And once an object has moved out or stolen, then the theft cannot be further located.

This brings us to a solution, which is geofencing a physical device attached to our belonging. This belonging would be a mere part of the IoT - Internet of 'Things'.

The above pictorial is a sample of Geofence in a public area. Best part? Since it is on a virtual map, having a virtual fence would have no effect on whether you own the area. This area could be your Home, Office, favorite Coffee Shop, or even parlor.

To be able to have global connectivity and uninterrupted internet, the ideal network protocol is cellular technology. With a GPS Module attached to it, it is just perfect.

This amazing combination can only be carried by an integrated device. And at the cheapest, we considered SIM808 Module+GPS as the primary module to continue with this project. Let us look more into its features and specifications -

SIM808 GSM :

Supports Quad-band 850/900/1800/1900MHz, compatible with all 2G networks all around the world.
Inner MT3337 GPS receiver, -165dBm precision, control on a same serial port.
Earphone/ microphone outputs on a card or external 32-ohm speaker + supports voice calls with an electret microphone.
Sending and receiving SMS.
Sending and receiving GPRS data (TCP/IP, HTTP vb).
UART communication with automatic baud rate settings.
GPRS multi-slot class 12/10
GPRS mobile station class B
Comply with GSM phase 2/2 +Class 4 (2 W @ 850 / 900MHz)Class 1 (1 W @ 1800 / 1900MHz)
Support low power consumption mode: 100mA @ 7V-GSM mode
Support AT command control (3GPP TS 27.007, 27.005 and SIMCOM enhanced AT Commands)
Supports GPS satellite navigation technology
Support LED status indicator: Power supply status, network status, and operating modes
Working environment: -40 ℃ ~ 85 ℃
SIM808 GPS :

22 tracking/66 acquisition channel
GPS L1 C/A code
Precision: Tracking: -165dBm,
Cold start: -148dBm
Finding Location Time(typical): Cold start: 32sn, Hot start: 1sn, Warm start: 5sn
Accuracy: ~2.5m
With all these features, it is nearly a handheld portable phone. Yes, you can make a phone call too :P

One grieving concern is, whether going ahead with a smaller size module would fit the portability requirements - Even if a SIM800 module was taken into consideration, for a prolonged secure network that requires more uptime it is a much safer option to go ahead with its successor. Hence, the SIM808 module was chosen for this project. Even though based on availability and price we can always go ahead with the SIM800.
